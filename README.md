# 👋 Hello, I’m Rodrigo (Watashi00)

I am a **Senior Back-end Developer** specialized in **Java, Spring Boot, and distributed systems**, with strong experience designing **scalable, maintainable, and production-ready architectures**.

I focus on building **robust back-end solutions**, from database modeling and business rules to API design, security, and deployment strategies.

- RESTful API design (API-first mindset)  
- Clean Architecture & layered systems  
- SOLID principles and Clean Code  
- Domain-driven thinking (business rules first)  
- High cohesion and low coupling

### 💬 Personal Note

I value **clarity, architecture, and long-term thinking**.  
My goal is not just to make systems work — but to make them **easy to evolve, scale, and trust**.
